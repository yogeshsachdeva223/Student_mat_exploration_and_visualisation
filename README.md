<h1>Data Exploration & Visualization Project on <u>Student-Mat</u> dataset using Python</h1>
<p>By Yogesh Sachdeva, Ayushi Arora and Kriti Suri</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this small project we tried to explore and visualize the student-mat dataset using python to conclude useful insights from it by establishing the relationship between different categorical and numerical variables. This dataset contains the final scores of students obtained in their math course with several inputs that can impact the score or future outcome of these students.</p>
<h2>Objectives of the Project:</h2>
<p>1) To explore the dataset for understanding the variables<br>2) To perform the data cleaning<br>3) To do the Data Visualization<br>4) Conclusions</p>
